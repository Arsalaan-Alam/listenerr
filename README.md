## Inspiration
Often I get bored reading and multitasking while reading is a no-no. So I felt the need for an app that allows you to listen to web articles. Hence you won't get bored reading as well as do things simultaneously while reading.


## What it does
Listenerr is a very efficient tool. All you need to do is paste the link of a web article, document or pdf or any text on the web. Our tool will scrape the content, convert it into audio to which you can listen to in multiple voices/accents in your browser!

## How we built it
We used HTML/CSS/JS/REACT to build the whole web app

## Challenges we ran into
- Scraping the crux of a webpage but we did it
- Switching different AI voices 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Completing the project
- Scraping and converting the content

## What we learned
We learned a big deal about cooperating.
We learned how to correctly use the fetch command
Time management skills

## What's next for Listenerr
We have many things in mind for Listenerr
- Creating our own AI which will detect the crux of articles (excluding ads and menus)
- Revamping the UI
- Turning it into a market-ready app
